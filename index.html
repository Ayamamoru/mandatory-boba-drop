        <h1>The rats once again</h1>
        <h2>Why didn't you join the rats before</h3>
        <p> Making a new rats site because this is mandatory and my old rats site is crusty</p>
        <h4> By the way, to reviewers. I've already done Boba drops before - this was just mandatory for the JPEG event, so I know I'm not eligable but it's required for the event!!</h4>

        <p>Rats are great, they are mean and evil and are coming to find you. They are also very intelligent and can be trained to do "tricks". It would be wise to join the rats while you can</p>
